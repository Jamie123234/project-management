                    <h2>Project Initiation & Planning</h2>
                    <p>The <strong>Planning Phase</strong> is arguably the most critical phase. It follows the Initiation Phase (where the project is authorized) and sets the roadmap for the entire project. Failure to plan is planning to fail.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Steps in the Planning Phase</h3>
                    <p>While steps can vary, three fundamental activities are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Define Scope & Create WBS:</strong> Clearly determining what the project will deliver (and what it won't). This is broken down into manageable tasks using a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).</li>
                        <li><strong>Develop Schedule:</strong> Identifying all activities, sequencing them, estimating their duration, and creating a project timeline (e.g., using a Gantt chart or network diagram).</li>
                        <li><strong>Create Budget & Resource Plan:</strong> Estimating the cost of all activities and resources (people, equipment) to create a cost baseline. This also involves identifying who is needed to do the work.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Project Selection Criteria</h2>
                    <p><strong>Importance:</strong> Before a project is even initiated, an organization must decide *which* projects to pursue. A set criterion is vital to ensure that resources are allocated to projects that provide the most value and align with the company's strategic goals. It removes emotion and bias from the decision.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Potential Selection Criteria</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Alignment:</strong> Does this project directly support the company's long-term goals (e.g., "enter a new market," "be a leader in healthcare tech")?</li>
                        <li><strong>Financial Value (ROI, NPV):</strong> Does the project have a positive financial outlook?
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Return on Investment (ROI):</strong> (Benefits - Costs) / Costs. A simple percentage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Net Present Value (NPV):</strong> Calculates the value of future cash flows in today's money. A positive NPV is good.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Feasibility:</strong> Do we have the technical expertise, resources, and budget to realistically complete this project?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Risk Management</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The systematic process of identifying, analyzing, planning for responses to, and monitoring risks that could impact a project's objectives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> To minimize the negative impact of threats and maximize the positive impact of opportunities.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Key Processes (Risk Management Cycle)</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Risk Identification:</strong> Finding potential risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Qualitative Risk Analysis:</strong> Assessing probability and impact (prioritizing).</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative Risk Analysis:</strong> Numerically analyzing the effect of risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk Response Planning:</strong> Developing strategies to deal with risks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Risk Monitoring & Control:</strong> Tracking risks and evaluating response plans.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Risk Identification</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The process of finding potential risks that could affect the project's objectives. It's the first and crucial step.</p>
                    <h3>Techniques for Risk Identification</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Brainstorming, Delphi Technique, Checklists, Interviews, SWOT Analysis.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>External Risks:</strong> Risks from outside the project/organization (e.g., new government regulation, bad weather, vendor failure).</li>
                        <li><strong>Human Resource Risks:</strong> Risks related to the team (e.g., key team member gets sick, team lacks required skills, low morale).</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Risk Assessment Matrix</h2>
                    <p>This is the primary tool for Qualitative Risk Analysis. It plots risks based on their likelihood and impact to determine their priority.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Risk:</strong> The potential event (e.g., "Vendor for conference food backs out").</li>
                        <li><strong>Likelihood (L,M,H):</strong> The probability that this risk will occur (Low, Medium, High).</li>
                        <li><strong>Impact (L,M,H):</strong> The degree of damage this risk would cause if it occurred (Low, Medium, High).</li>
                        <li><strong>Action on Trigger:</strong> What specific event will cause the Response Plan to be activated (e.g., "Vendor misses final confirmation deadline").</li>
                        <li><strong>Response Plan:</strong> The strategy developed in advance to deal with the risk.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Common Risk Response Plans (for Threats)</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Change the project plan to eliminate the risk (e.g., use a different, more reliable technology).</li>
                        <li><strong>Mitigate:</strong> Reduce the probability or impact of the risk (e.g., hire a backup vendor just in case).</li>
                        <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Shift the impact of the risk to a third party (e.g., buy insurance for the event).</li>
                        <li><strong>Accept:</strong> Acknowledge the risk and do nothing (used for low-priority risks).</li>

                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The sequence of activities with <strong>zero slack</strong> that determines the project's total duration. It is the <strong>longest path</strong> through the network diagram.</p>
                    <p>Any delay on a critical path activity will delay the entire project completion date.</p>

                    <h2>Resources Availability</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The extent towhich the necessary resources (people, equipment, materials, etc.) are available when needed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Skills & Expertise, Capacity, Timing, Location, and Cost.</p>

                    <h2>Budget Constraints</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The financial limitations imposed on the project – the total amount of money available.</p>
                    <p><strong>Considerations:</strong> Total Budget, Budget Allocation, Contingency Reserves, and Management Reserves.</p>

                    <h2>Resource Levelling</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A technique to adjust schedules to reduce resource over-allocations (e.g., one person assigned 16 hours of work in one day) <strong>without</strong> changing the project end date. This is done by using the 'slack' on non-critical activities.</p>
                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Smooth out resource usage, improve utilization, and reduce conflicts.</p>

                    <h2>Resource Constrained Planning</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A technique used when project resources are strictly limited and cannot be increased. This is a common, real-world constraint.</p>
                    <p><strong>How it Works:</strong> The project schedule is dictated by the resource limits. If you only have one senior developer (a constraint), tasks that could otherwise run in parallel must now be done sequentially. This process often <strong>extends the project's critical path and delays the end date.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a network diagram, Activity A and Activity B could start at the same time. But if they both require the same constrained resource (e.g., a testing machine), one must wait, and the project timeline will be longer than the original CPM calculation.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Costs</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Direct Costs:</strong> Directly attributable to the project (e.g., project team salaries, materials).</li>
                        <li><strong>Indirect Costs (Overhead):</strong> Necessary for the organization but not tied to one project (e.g., office rent, utilities).</li>
                        <li><strong>Fixed Costs:</strong> Remain constant (e.g., rent, software licenses).</li>
                        <li><strong>Variable Costs:</strong> Change with project scope or duration (e.g., materials per unit, hourly labor).</li>

                    <h2>Tuckman's Model of Team Development (1965)</h2>
                    <p>A 5-stage model describing how teams develop:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Forming:</strong> Team members get to know each other.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storming:</strong> Conflicts arise as members assert opinions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Norming:</strong> Conflicts resolve, norms are established. (Note: Conflict can still arise after this, as noted in the past paper).</li>
                        <li><strong>Performing:</strong> The team reaches peak performance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Adjourning:</strong> The team disbands.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Project Manager Leadership Skills</h2>
                    <p>A PM must guide the team. Key leadership abilities include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Setting the Vision:</strong> Clearly communicating the project's purpose and end goal ("the why") to motivate the team.</li>
                        <li><strong>Facilitating Participation & Consultation:</strong> Creating an open environment where all team members feel safe to share ideas, ask questions, and contribute to decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Empowering the Team:</strong> Delegating authority and trusting the team to make decisions and manage their own work, leading to higher morale and ownership.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoiding Unnecessary Work:</strong> Protecting the team from "scope creep" and "gold plating" (adding extra features) that don't add value, keeping them focused on what's essential.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Conflict Management</h2>
                    <p>Conflict is inevitable. The PM must address it before it harms the project.</p>
                    <h3>Common Sources of Conflict</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Schedules & Priorities:</strong> Disagreements about when tasks should be done or what is most important.</li>
                        <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Two team members needing the same resource at the same time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Opinions:</strong> Disagreements on the best way to build something.</li>
                        <li><strong>Personal Work Styles:</strong> Clashes in how people approach their work.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Conflict Handling Methods</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compromising:</strong> A "lose-lose" solution where both parties give up something to find a middle ground. Useful when a quick, temporary fix is needed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Accommodating:</strong> A "lose-win" solution where one party gives in to the other. Useful when the issue is more important to the other person or to preserve harmony.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Problem-Solving Approach</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Develop a Problem Statement:</strong> Clearly and concisely define the *actual* problem, not just the symptoms. (e.g., "The login page load time is 8 seconds," not "The app is slow").</li>
                        <li><strong>Gather Data & Verify Causes:</strong> Collect facts and investigate potential root causes. (e.g., check server logs, database queries, network latency).</li>
                        <li><strong>Evaluate Alternative Solutions:</strong> Brainstorm multiple potential solutions and evaluate them based on criteria like cost, time, and effectiveness.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h2>Effective Time Management</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Using methods like the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) to focus on high-value tasks.</li>
                        <li><strong>Time Blocking:</strong> Scheduling specific blocks of time for specific tasks in your calendar.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Pomodoro Technique:</strong> Working in focused 25-minute intervals with a 5-minute break.</li>
                        <li><strong>Delegation:</strong> Assigning tasks to other team members when appropriate.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoiding Multitasking:</strong> Focusing on one task at a time to improve quality and speed.</li>

                    <h2>Project Management Information Systems (PMIS)</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A system (often software, but also processes and people) used to collect, store, manage, analyze, and distribute project information. It supports all project phases.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Provide a central repository for data, facilitate communication, automate tasks, support decision-making, and improve project visibility and control.</p>
                    <p><strong>Components/Examples:</strong> Microsoft Project, Jira, Asana, Slack, SharePoint, Google Drive, plus the defined processes for using them.</p>

                    <h2>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The simplest version of a product that has enough features to satisfy early adopters and provide feedback for future development. It focuses on the core value proposition.</p>
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Validate a product idea quickly, gather early user feedback, and reduce development costs.</p>

                    <h2>Scrum</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An iterative and incremental agile framework for managing complex projects. It's based on time-boxes (Sprints) and emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and adaptation.</p>
                    <h3>Key Elements:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Roles:</strong> Product Owner (defines *what*), Scrum Master (facilitates *how*), Development Team (builds).</li>
                        <li><strong>Artifacts:</strong> Product Backlog (all features), Sprint Backlog (features for this sprint), Increment (shippable product).</li>
                        <li><strong>Events:</strong> Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> A time-boxed period (1-4 weeks) to create an Increment.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Kanban</h2>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An agile method for managing workflow. It focuses on visualizing the work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and continuously improving flow.</p>
                    <h3>Key Principles:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Visualize Workflow:</strong> Use a Kanban board (To Do, In Progress, Done).</li>
                        <li><strong>Limit Work in Progress (WIP):</strong> Set explicit limits on items allowed in each stage (e.g., max 3 items "In Progress").</li>
                        <li><strong>Manage Flow:</strong> Focus on moving work items smoothly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make Policies Explicit:</strong> Clearly define rules for moving items.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Difference from Scrum:</strong> Scrum is time-boxed (Sprints) with specific roles/events. Kanban is flow-based, focusing on WIP limits and continuous improvement without prescribed time-boxes.</p>
